# autocompleteTries
Implementing autocomplete feature using tries
The program takes a set of keys(strings) from the user and builds a trie.
It later asks the user to provide a prefix to search.
But alas! it does all this in the console!..
It would be great to attach a UI to it and add more features to it.. such as :
1. Importing the set of strings from outside (A dictionary or something)
2. Adding the prefixes to the database if they are not found by our search.
3. Deleting a particular string from the trie.
